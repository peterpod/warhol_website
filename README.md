Read Me - Peter Podniesinski

This project is dedicated to promote and 
display the artwork of Andy Warhol at the CMU
Miller Galley. It requires contact information,
exhibit information, gallery display and many 
other features.

The project is a fictional scenario, however,
it was an interesting assignment to test 
our web skills.
