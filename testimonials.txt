TestimonialsThis exhibition pays a great tribute to an artist I only knew as a pop icon before coming here.  Little did I know that Andy Warhol had so many different styles and periods during his life.The Andy Warhol CMU exhibition is a great experience for a lot of different reasons. It manages to be true to its inspiration, yet is accessible to a wide range of people.  Job well done and can't wait to go back!Great exhibit. Even if you don't like Warhol's work you may still find it pretty intriguing.As a Carnegie Mellon student, I'm always looking for ways to learn more about alums.  This was such a great tribute to Andy Warhol and the accomplishments of one of our own.
