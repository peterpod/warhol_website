     <h1>Biography</h1>
     <p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andy Warhol (August 6, 1928 - February 22, 1987) was an 
American artist who was a leading figure in the visual art movement known as pop art. His works
 explore the relationship between artistic expression, celebrity culture and advertisement 
 that flourished by the 1960s. After a successful career as a commercial illustrator, Warhol 
 became a renowned and sometimes controversial artist. The Andy Warhol Museum in his native
  city, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, holds an extensive permanent collection of art and archives.
   It is the largest museum in the United States of America dedicated to a single artist.
Warhol's artwork ranged in many forms of media that include hand drawing, painting, printmaking,
 photography, silk screening, sculpture, film, and music. He was a pioneer in computer-generated
  art using Amiga computers that were introduced in 1985, just before his death in 1987.

</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He founded Interview Magazine and was the author of numerous
 books, including The Philosophy of Andy Warhol and Popism: The Warhol Sixties. Andy Warhol is
  also notable as a gay man who lived openly as such before the gay liberation movement. His studio,
   The Factory, was a famous gathering place that brought together distinguished intellectuals,
    drag queens, playwrights, Bohemian street people, Hollywood celebrities, and wealthy patrons.
Warhol has been the subject of numerous retrospective exhibitions, books, and feature and documentary
 films. He coined the widely used expression "15 minutes of fame". Many of his creations are very 
 collectible and highly valuable. The highest price ever paid for a Warhol painting is US$100 million 
 for a 1963 canvas titled Eight Elvises. The private transaction was reported in a 2009 article in
  The Economist, which described Warhol as the "bellwether of the art market". Warhol's works include 
  some of the most expensive paintings ever sold.

     <h2>College Years</h2>
     <p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he entered the Carnegie Institute of Technology 
(now Carnegie Mellon University) as a freshman in 1945, Andrew Warhol embarked on the formal road 
to what would become one of the most celebrated art careers of the 20th-century. With America 
embroiled in the final throes of World War II and the steel mills and factories of Pittsburgh churning 
out heavy materials at full tilt, the rarefied world of the academy (with classes taught by artists 
Balcomb Greene, Robert Lepper, Samuel Rosenberg, and Howard Worner, among others) would have been
 a comforting realm within which the future Andy Warhol (he dropped the final in the 1950s to make
  his name seem less ethnic) could develop his aesthetic voice. The day before he entered college,
   Warhol sat for a portrait photo in a small photo studio operated by his middle brother, John, 
   and their cousin Johnny Preksta. Interestingly enough, in relation to Warhol's yet-to-come work
    of the early-1960s, it consisted of a photobooth machine, and the customers received not just
     the black-and-white product, but a hand-colored portrait. However, in 1945 and 1946 Warhol 
     struggled with his first-year classes in the Department of Painting and Design., resulting in 
     him having to take a summer drawing class so that he could refine his draftsmanship to please 
     his professors.The drawings made in the summer of 1946 are technically mature images of women
      buying fruits and vegetables on the streets of Warholos childhood neighborhood of South 
      Oakland, mere blocks away from Carnegie Tech. Warhol spent many days that summer observing 
      his oldest brother, Paul, who sold produce from a truck, and the resultant pictures that he
       made of those commercial transactions won Warhol accolades upon his return to school in 
       the fall when he received the Martin B. Leisser Prize and had the works exhibited in the 
       colleges fine arts gallery. From that point forward, Warhol was a star student in the 
       program and, over the course of his entire college career, learned all of the many skills
        that a successful commercial illustrator would be expected to know in the job market.
</br>
</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While at Carnegie Tech, Warhol became involved in various student 
activities, including the Modern Dance Club (he was the only male in the group) and the Beaux Arts 
Society. He worked as an editor of the student publication Cano, designing a cover for the magazine
 in November 1948. His artistic experimentations in 1947 and 1948 led him to develop what would 
 one d-ay become his signature drawing style -- the blotted line technique -- in which he would 
 ink an image in reverse on a vellum-like paper and then tamp it down onto a clean sheet of paper,
  resulting in a drippy and imperfect line that was slightly reminiscent of artist Ben Shahn, but
   still highly unique and playful. In the summer between his sophomore and junior years, Warhol 
   took a summer job in the display department of Horne's Department Store in downtown Pittsburgh
    where he continued to hone his skills of selling products through visual enticement.Warhol's 
    involvement with the Associated Artists of Pittsburgh group of regional artists now celebrating 
    its 100th-anniversary - was both positive and negative to the young artist. In 1948, two of
     Warhol's works were selected for inclusion in the AAP's annual juried show, a painting titled
      I Like Dance and a print titled Dance in Black and White. The titles alone show Warhol's
       great interest in dance - and in fact he once said that he would rather have been a ballerina
        than an artist - but unfortunately, his fellow members of the Modern Dance Club thought 
        that Warhol's skills would best be utilized in designing the groups programs in lieu of him
         actually taking to the stage. His important Dance Diagram paintings from the early 1960s would 
         ultimately find their inspiration in Warhol's early forays into the subject.


</br>
</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following year, Warhol tasted the thrill of aesthetic 
controversy when he was rejected from the 1949 AAP juried exhibition after submitting his The 
Broad Gave Me My Face, But I Can Pick My Own Nose painting at the beginning of his last semester 
of his senior year. Featuring a young man gingerly picking his nose, the facial details of the 
painting suggest that its a self-portrait of Warhol, no doubt thumbing his nose at the establishment
 as he would do throughout his lifetime. The jury declined to accept the work over the protests of
  juror George Grosz, the elderly German artist who was known for his caricatures of society.
By his graduation in June 1949, Warhol changed the name of the painting to Don't Pick on Me and
 submitted it to a student exhibition, where it attracted considerable attention. Recently, several
  of Warhol's classmates have recalled that the painting was originally titled The Lord Gave Me My
   Face, But I Can Pick My Own Nose, and it somehow was twisted into the more audacious meaning with
    the word "broad." Within weeks of graduating from Carnegie Tech, Warhol and fellow classmate 
    Phillip Pearlstein departed Pittsburgh and moved to New York City, where over the course of
     their decades-long careers, both would rise to the upper echelons of the art world establishment.
      Warhol's formative years soaking in the art of commercial illustration would indeed serve 
      him well, first as the most celebrated graphic artist of the 1950s and later on as one of 
      the pioneers of the Pop Art movement of the early 1960s.
